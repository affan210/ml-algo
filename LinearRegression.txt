Types of linear regression model to use:
1. Simple Linear Regression: For a single independent variable.
2. Multiple Linear Regression: For multiple independent variables.

Training:
The goal is to find the coefficients b0, b1, ..., bn that minimize the error between predicted values and actual values. For simple linear regression, the model is represented as:
y = b0 + b1.x​

For multiple linear regression with n independent variables:
y = b0 + b1.x1 + b2.x2 + ...+ bn.xn
​

To find these coefficients, you can use the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted values.
