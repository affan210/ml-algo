Types of linear regression model to use:
1. Simple Linear Regression: For a single independent variable.
2. Multiple Linear Regression: For multiple independent variables.

Training:
The goal is to find the coefficients b0, b1, ..., bn that minimize the error between predicted values and actual values. For simple linear regression, the model is represented as:
y = b0 + b1.x​

For multiple linear regression with n independent variables:
y = b0 + b1.x1 + b2.x2 + ...+ bn.xn
​

To find these coefficients, you can use the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted values. 

# Algorithms for Regression Problems
Here are some commonly used regression algorithms:
1. Simple Linear Regression: 
    Used when there is a linear relationship between the input feature and the target variable.

2. Multiple Linear Regression: 
    Extends simple linear regression to multiple input features.

3. Polynomial Regression:
    Captures nonlinear relationships between features and the target variable by introducing polynomial terms into the regression equation.

4. Ridge Regression:
    A form of linear regression that includes L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

5. Lasso Regression:
    Similar to ridge regression but uses L1 regularization, which can lead to feature selection by pushing some feature coefficients to zero.

6. Elastic Net Regression:
    Combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to balance their effects.

7. Support Vector Regression (SVR):
    An extension of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for regression tasks. It uses a kernel function to map the data into a higher-dimensional space and find a hyperplane that best fits the data.

8. Decision Tree Regression:
    Uses decision trees to model the relationship between features and the target variable. It can handle both linear and nonlinear relationships.

9. Random Forest Regression:
    Ensembles of decision trees that can provide more accurate and stable predictions by averaging or taking a majority vote from multiple trees.

10. Gradient Boosting Regression:
    Algorithms like Gradient Boosting Trees (GBM), XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost build an ensemble of decision trees sequentially to improve predictive accuracy.

11. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression:
    Predicts the target value by averaging the values of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

12. Neural Networks (Deep Learning):
    Deep neural networks can be used for regression tasks by training them to predict continuous values.

13. Bayesian Regression:
    Uses Bayesian techniques to estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters and make predictions based on probability distributions.

14. Gaussian Process Regression:
    Models the target variable as a Gaussian process, which allows for probabilistic predictions and uncertainty estimation.

15. Quantile Regression:
    Estimates different quantiles of the target variable's distribution, making it useful for robust regression and handling outliers.

16. Isotonic Regression:
    Fits a piecewise constant, non-decreasing function to the data. It's suitable for problems where the relationship between the features and the target is monotonic.

17. Robust Regression:
    Methods like Huber Regression and RANSAC are robust to outliers and noise in the data.
